## Features

- **Rapid development with shadcn**: 
  Leveraged Shadcn for its highly customizable components, allowing for rapid development without compromising on design flexibility. This tool was instrumental in quickly setting up a modern, responsive UI, saving significant development time.

- **SEO optimization**: 
  Integrated `@seo.ts` to enhance the application's search engine visibility. This module dynamically generates metadata tags, ensuring that each page is optimized for search engines, which is crucial for improving discoverability and driving organic traffic.

- **Testing with Vitest**: 
  Implemented Vitest to facilitate robust testing of components and application logic. 

- **Flexible social links component**: 
  Developed a shared `@social-links.tsx` component that allows for dynamic rendering of social media icons. By passing a prop, you can easily customize which social links appear in the header and footer, enhancing the component's reusability and adaptability.

- **404 Page**: 
  Created a custom 404 page to provide a seamless user experience when navigating to a non-existent page. This page not only informs users about the error but also offers a friendly way to return to the home page.

## Improvements

- **Enhanced Testing Coverage**: 
  Plan to expand the test suite to cover more components and edge cases, ensuring comprehensive validation of the application's functionality and performance.

- **CMS Integration**: 
  Consider integrating a Content Management System (CMS) to streamline content updates and page creation. This would empower non-technical users to manage content efficiently, reducing the dependency on developers for routine updates.
